Numerosity is a games-based assessement tool used by HireVue. The objective is as follows: you are given a target value, an operand, and a list of integers. You must find the sublist of integers in an exact order which, when added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided produce the target value. This initially starts extremely easy, but becomes very difficult quickly.
